 * bounding the real per-image multimodal token cost a single caller could run
 * up. Checked in the adapter BEFORE the MIME/byte check and any fetch, per
 * the acceptance criteria, so an at-cap sender never has their attachment
 * inspected further. `key` MUST be platform-qualified (`` `discord:${senderId}` ``)
 * even though only Discord implements image input today, matching the
 * defensive convention `reserveVoiceTranscriptionSlot` already established.

 * cap (issue #507; platform-qualified in issue #732 —
 * `config.whatsapp.voice.rateLimitPerHour` /
 * `config.discord.voice.rateLimitPerHour`). Per-sender rather than
 * per-conversation (unlike `reserveWebSearchSlot`) since this bounds one
 * person's own audio volume, not a shared conversation. Returns false
 * without reserving if the sender already hit `limit` within the last hour.
 * Called from `BaileysAdapter`/`DiscordAdapter` BEFORE any media download,
 * so a refused slot never triggers a download/decode/model run. Callers must
 * skip this entirely when `limit` is 0 (unlimited) so the default
 * configuration does no bookkeeping. `key` MUST be platform-qualified
 * (e.g. `` `whatsapp:${senderId}` ``/`` `discord:${senderId}` ``) — a bare
 * sender id would let a WhatsApp phone number and a Discord snowflake that
 * happen to collide share one quota bucket across platforms (issue #732).

# Architecture

The Community Agent is a single long-running Node service that connects the
**NZ Claude Community** Discord server and a dedicated **WhatsApp** number to a
Claude-powered agent, with a Postgres-backed memory for learning.

## Components

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/config.ts` | Loads + validates all env (zod). Fails fast on misconfig. |
| `src/platforms/types.ts` | `PlatformAdapter` interface + normalised `IncomingMessage`. The seam that decouples the agent from any specific chat platform. |
| `src/platforms/discord/adapter.ts` | discord.js client; normalises messages, resolves roles, performs moderation actions. |
| `src/platforms/whatsapp/baileysAdapter.ts` | WhatsApp via Baileys (linked-device protocol, dedicated number). |
| `src/platforms/whatsapp/cloudAdapter.ts` | The official Meta Cloud API adapter — webhook intake + Graph API send, the documented upgrade path from Baileys. |
| `src/auth/rbac.ts` | Role resolution (`admin`/`user`) + the per-role allowed-tool lists. |
| `src/agent/core.ts` | Runs one agent turn: memory recall → prompt → `query()` → reply. |
| `src/agent/tools.ts` | In-process MCP tools (search memory/knowledge, moderate, announce, …). |
| `src/agent/auth.ts` | Forces Claude **subscription** auth via `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. |
| `src/storage/*` | Postgres pool, schema, migrations, embeddings, repository. |
| `src/router.ts` | Orchestrates inbound → agent → outbound and persistence. |
| `src/health.ts` / `src/healthState.ts` | `/healthz` endpoint + sustained-disconnect super-admin alerting; `healthState.ts` holds the pure, tested debounce/payload logic. |

## Memory & "learning"

Because the agent authenticates with a Claude **subscription** (not the API),
there's no fine-tuning. "Learning" is implemented as **retrieval-augmented
memory**:

1. **Every** inbound and outbound message is written to `interactions` with a
   locally-computed embedding (transformers.js, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384-dim).
2. On each turn the agent semantically searches prior interactions in the
   *current conversation* (`pgvector` cosine distance, HNSW index) and injects
   the top hits into the **user turn** inside a delimited untrusted-data block
   (never the system prompt — see SECURITY.md on prompt injection).
3. The `remember_search` / `knowledge_search` tools let the model query memory
   on demand mid-turn. Cross-conversation search is admin-only.
4. Admins can promote durable facts into `knowledge` via `save_knowledge`, and
   curate existing entries with `list_knowledge` (browse by scope),
   `update_knowledge` (correct + re-embed), and `delete_knowledge` (retire,
   CONFIRM-gated).

Conversation continuity uses the Agent SDK's session resume: the Claude
`session_id` for each `(platform, conversation)` is stored in `sessions` and
passed back as `resume` on the next turn.

## RBAC (three tiers + gated access)

Tiers: **super_admin > admin > member > guest**.

- **super_admin** — env-bootstrapped (`SUPER_ADMIN_DISCORD_IDS` /
  `SUPER_ADMIN_WHATSAPP_NUMBERS`); never grantable via chat. Full access.
- **admin** — granted by a super admin (`grant_admin`); stored in
  `community_users`. Privileged data access is **scoped to conversations the
  admin actually participates in** — the adapter resolves their real channel/
  group membership (cached ~60s) and that list becomes a SQL filter.
- **member** — granted by an admin (`add_member`); stored in `community_users`.
- **guest** — everyone else. In **gated** mode (`ACCESS_MODE_*=gated`, the
  default) guests get a "ask an admin to add you" pointer and their message
  content is **not stored** — only that they asked (identity + count, in
  `access_requests`; see "Onboarding" below). In `open` mode guests get
  member-level tools.

The router resolves the tier (env + DB — never message content), and the agent
core passes `toolsForRole(tier)` as `allowedTools`, so lower tiers are
**structurally incapable** of invoking higher-tier tools — the tool isn't even
offered to the model. Each privileged tool re-asserts the tier
(`assertAtLeast`), destructive actions additionally require an out-of-band
CONFIRM reply (handled deterministically by the router, never by the model),
and every privileged action is audited and alerted to super admins by DM.

| Capability | guest (gated) | member | admin | super_admin |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Talk to the bot | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Search memory (own conversation), knowledge, `forget_me` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Memory/history across conversations | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ *their conversations* | ✅ all |
| `moderate` / `announce` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ *their conversations*, confirm-gated | ✅ anywhere |
| `save_knowledge` / `list_knowledge` / `update_knowledge` / `delete_knowledge` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅, delete confirm-gated | ✅ |
| `list_access_requests` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ *(not conversation-scoped — see below)* | ✅ |
| `add_member` / `remove_member` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (member tier only) | ✅ |
| Web search & summarise (`WebSearch`; `WebFetch` never) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `grant_admin` / `revoke_admin`, `purge_user_data`, `audit_view`, `usage_stats`, `pause_bot`, `set_policy` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

Behaviour guardrails on top: per-user daily reply budget
(`DAILY_REPLY_LIMIT_PER_USER`), session caps (`SESSION_MAX_TURNS`/`_AGE_HOURS`),
and an outbound filter on every reply — secret redaction plus the
`code_answers` policy (`off`/`snippets`/`full`, set via `set_policy`).

## Onboarding (gated mode)

Two pieces make the default gated experience less friction-y without
weakening it:

1. **Welcome message** (Discord only — WhatsApp has no equivalent "join"
   event). Off unless `DISCORD_WELCOME_ENABLED=true`. On join, `DiscordAdapter`
   sends a static, non-agent DM (no LLM call, no cost) pointing the new member
   at an admin; if their DMs are closed, it falls back to posting in
   `DISCORD_WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID` if configured.
2. **Pending-access queue**. When a gated guest addresses the bot,
   `router.ts` upserts a row into `access_requests` (platform, user id/name,
   first/last-requested timestamps, request count) — deliberately *never*
   their message content, preserving the existing no-storage invariant for
   guests. Admins call `list_access_requests` to see who's waiting instead of
   relying on informal pings; `add_member` clears the row for that user once
   actioned.

## Concurrency model

- The router **serialises turns per conversation** (a promise chain keyed by
  `platform:conversationId`) because session resume is not safe to run
  concurrently for the same session.
- Different conversations run in parallel.
- A light **per-user rate limit** (8 msg / 60s) protects against spam and
  runaway cost.

### Known cost/latency characteristic

Each `query()` call spawns a Claude Code CLI subprocess and (when resuming)
re-reads the conversation's session file. On a small VPS expect roughly one to
a few seconds of overhead per answered message, growing with session length.
If this becomes a problem: cap session length (start fresh after N turns), or
move to the SDK's streaming-input mode with a persistent process per busy
conversation.

## Health & monitoring

`Restart=always` (`deploy/community-agent.service`) and the startup
`healthcheck()` only catch the process crashing or the DB being unreachable
at boot — neither catches "process alive, one platform connection silently
dead" (e.g. a banned WhatsApp number stuck in Baileys' reconnect loop).
`src/health.ts` covers that steady-state gap:

- **Sustained-disconnect alerting** (always on, no config to disable) — a
  30s periodic check across every registered adapter's `isConnected()`. Past
  `HEALTH_ALERT_AFTER_MINUTES` (default 5) of continuous disconnection, it
  DMs configured super admins via whichever adapter(s) are still up and logs
  at `error`. Debounced: one alert per outage, not one per check tick;
  reconnecting clears the state silently (no "it's back!" spam).
- **`/healthz`** (opt-in via `HEALTH_PORT`) — unauthenticated `GET` returning
  `{status: "ok"|"degraded", db: boolean, adapters: {discord: boolean,
  whatsapp: boolean}}`. No message content or user ids in the response.
  Intended for an external uptime monitor; bind to localhost and put a
  reverse proxy in front if exposing it, same guidance as the Cloud API
  webhook port.
- `WhatsAppCloudAdapter.isConnected()` reflects whether its local HTTP
  listener is up, not whether Meta can currently reach it — it's a
  stateless webhook receiver with no persistent connection to track the way
  Baileys/Discord have.

The debounce/payload logic lives in `src/healthState.ts`, deliberately free
of config/HTTP/adapter imports so it's unit-tested directly (`src/health.ts`
is the thin I/O wrapper around it).

## Switching WhatsApp providers

The Baileys adapter is the default (immediate, free, dedicated number, but
against WhatsApp ToS — ban risk). The official Meta **Cloud API** is
implemented as `WhatsAppCloudAdapter` and is the recommended path for any
bot expected to run continuously:

1. Set `WHATSAPP_PROVIDER=cloud` and `WHATSAPP_CLOUD_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`,
   `WHATSAPP_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_CLOUD_VERIFY_TOKEN`,
   `WHATSAPP_CLOUD_APP_SECRET`, and optionally `WHATSAPP_CLOUD_WEBHOOK_PORT`
   (default `8080`).
2. Point your Meta app's webhook subscription at
   `http://<host>:<port>/` (any path — the adapter listens on all paths) with
   the same verify token, and expose it over HTTPS via a reverse proxy (see
   `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`).

The adapter verifies every inbound webhook's `X-Hub-Signature-256` HMAC
against `WHATSAPP_CLOUD_APP_SECRET` before parsing the body. Because the
Cloud API is 1:1-only (no groups), `adminCapabilities` only advertises
`warn_user`; other moderation actions report as unsupported. Free-form
outbound replies are only sent within Meta's 24h customer-service window
(tracked in-process from the timestamp of the sender's last inbound
message); sends outside that window fail with a clear error rather than
being attempted.

`WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_JIDS` is shared between both adapters but each entry can be
either a bare phone-number digit string or a full Baileys-style JID
(`64211234567@s.whatsapp.net`) — the Cloud adapter matches against the part
before `@`, so the same list works for either adapter without reformatting.

Nothing in `router.ts`, `agent/*`, or `storage/*` changes — they only depend on
the `PlatformAdapter` interface.
